            <h2>Welcome! Thanks for interviewing with Mersive Technologies!</h2>
            <p>
              We're going to work with some trees today. Our goal with this
              exercise isn't to "stump" anyone with tricky business, but to give
              candidates a fair and uniform way to express themselves in code on
              a realistic-ish problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              In an hour, we expect everyone will get some of the way through
              this problem, but no one will get all the way through. If invited
              to a technical interview, you'll pair with us wherever you left
              off, because we'd much rather see how you work on a problem you're
              familiar with and have had time to think about than on some clever
              whiteboard puzzle we spring on you.
            </p>
            <p>At this stage, we care most about:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Interpreting written specifications (following instructions)</li>
              <li>General familiarity with layout, data modeling, interaction, network I/O</li>
              <li>Legible code</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              When in doubt, do less, better. üòÄ

                First, layout and style:

                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Replace the inline <code>&nbsp</code> "styling" with an improved layout
                    by editing the JSX, HTML, and CSS in the <code>./src/index.js</code>
                    and <code>./index.css</code> files.
                  </li>

                    Add a JSON object to that file that represents our

                    at the correct indentation level. There should be one text
                    input at level 0 after frog, one at level 1 directly above
